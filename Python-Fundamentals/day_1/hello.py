"""
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. 
- This means that prototyping can be very quick.
- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

To run this file:
    - Simply, locate the python file folder in terminal like:
        - `cd \Python-Learning\Python-Fundamentals\day_1`
    - Then execute:
        - `py hello.py` or `python hello.py` or `python3 hello.py`
        - why py/python/python3 before python file?
            - When you install Python on Windows, it installs a small program called Python Launcher named:
                - py.exe
            - This launcher helps Windows find the correct Python version installed on your system.
            - It avoids confusion if multiple Python versions are installed
